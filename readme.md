# Project Tasks

This project consists of four tasks, each with its own HTML and CSS files. Here's a brief description of each task:

## [Task A](task_A/index.html)

This task involves creating a table with specific styles. The styles are defined in [task_A/css/style.css](task_A/css/style.css). The table is styled with a margin, border, border-radius, padding, and box-shadow.

## [Task B](task_B/index.html)

In this task, we create a webpage with articles. The articles have specific styles for the body, section, h1, and paragraphs. The styles are defined in [task_B/css/style.css](task_B/css/style.css). There's also a special style for a scrolling article.

## [Task C](task_C/index.html)

This task is about styling text and links with different colors. The styles are defined in [task_C/css/style.css](task_C/css/style.css). The HTML file [task_C/index.html](task_C/index.html) contains a section with paragraphs and lists, each with different styles.

## [Task D](task_D/index.html)

In this task, we create a container with sections and divs. The styles are defined in [task_D/css/style.css](task_D/css/style.css). The container and its children have specific styles for background color, display, padding, margin, color, width, height, font-weight, and text-align.

Remember to open each HTML file in a browser to see the result of the styles applied.
